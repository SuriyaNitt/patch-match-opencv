Specialization of [my implementation](https://github.com/antoinewdg/patch-match-core) of the PatchMatch algorithm for 
OpenCV images.

It provides out-of-the box implementation of the various wrappers needed by the algorithm, and provides utilities to build 
custom ones.

## Documentation

This project has currently no documentation because I do not see anyone having an immediate use of it besides myself, if you feel it could be of any use to you or have any question feel free to contact me.
